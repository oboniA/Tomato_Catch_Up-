The research was conducted using Tomato leaf images from PlantVillage dataset to classify from ten different health categories. The dataset was pre-processed to enhance images and address data imbalance. Project leveraged VGG16â€™s convolutional blocks as a feature extractor using transfer learning and built Random Forest as a classifier. Similarly, a custom Neural Network architecture was designed and stacked on top of the feature extractor to build a second classifier. Both classifiers were optimized using hyperparameter tuning techniques. Because CNN outperformed, the model was finalised to be deployed into a web interface to allow users to upload infected images and determine plant health.
